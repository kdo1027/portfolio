        hey! welcome to my space! here are some (random?) facts about me (˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧
        <br />
        <br />
        i’m nic(holas), but i go online by kdo (short for my real name). 
        <br />
        <br />
        i love reading, traveling, listening to music, observing surroundings, and learning new things 👀.
        you can usually find me taking long walks, sitting in a coffee shop all day, and trying to craft a random idea out of my head. 
        sometimes, i just love to go around and try new things at every opportunity while pushing myself out of my comfort zone ˙✧˖°📷 ༘ ⋆｡˚. 
        <br />
        <br />
        i learned how to code while thinking about how to turn a random lego into a personal assistant. 
        i’ve created various digital apps helping people in my community, striving to revolutionize different fields from finance to healthcare. 
        i love building meaningful technologies that make the world a better place and simplify life for everyone. ‧₊˚🖇️✩ ₊˚🎧⊹♡
        <br />
        <br />
        i like to learn as much as i can from the amazing people around me so plz connect!!! (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)
